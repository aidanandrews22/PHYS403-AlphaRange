\begin{abstract}
    In this experiment, we investigate the range of alpha particles from Americium-241 in various gases.
    Using a solid state detector, and by varying the pressure to simulate various distances, we obtain a relationship between energy and distance.
    With our data, we were also able to obtain a relationship between count rate and distance.
    Using this information, we were able to verify various theoretical predictions of energy loss within these media.
    We then compare these results with accepted values from the NIST.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%===============================================================================

As alpha particles travel through a medium, they lose energy primarily through ionization, or the excitation of electrons in surrounding atoms.
Because alpha particles are much heavier than the electrons they scatter off, each collision transfers very little transverse momentum to the alpha particle; for this reason, they travel in nearly straight lines as they dissipate their energy.

A model for the stopping power of a medium can be found in \cite[pg. 159; eq. 2.10]{mel66}, which we restate here for convenience.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:berte}
	-\diff{E}{x}= \paren{\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}}\frac{4\pi z^2 e^4}{m_ev^2}n_e \sbrak{\ln\paren{\frac{2m_e v^2}{I(1-\beta^2)}} - \beta^2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
	e &= \text{charge on an electron (C)} \\
	z &= \text{atomic number of moving particle (z=2 for alpha particles)} \\
	n_e &= \text{electron number density (m}^{-3}\text{)} \\
	m_e &= \text{mass of an electron (kg)} \\
	v &= \text{velocity of moving particle (m/s)} \\
	E &= \text{kinetic energy of moving particle (J)} \\
	I &= \text{Mean ionization potential of medium (J)} \\
	x &= \text{traveled distance of moving particle (m)} \\
	\epsilon_0 &= \text{permittivity of free space (N\,m}^2\text{/C}^2\text{)}
\end{align*}
In this experiment, since our particles are relatively low-energy (around 5.443 MeV), we take the non-relativistic limit, which \cite[pg. 158]{mel66} gives as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:berte-non-rel}
	-\diff{E}{x} \propto \frac{z^2M}{E}
\end{equation}
For some constant of proportionality, this relation can be integrated to obtain the following:
\begin{align}
	\int_{E_0}^{E} E' \,dE' &= \int_0^{r}-kz^2M \,dx \\
	{E}^2 - {E_0}^2 &= -2kz^2Mr. \label{eq:e2-linear-rel}
\end{align}
Therefore, we expect a linear relationship between $E^2$: the energy of the particle, $r$: the distance traveled, and $E_0$: the initial energy of the particle.

In this experiment, our goal is to verify equation \ref{eq:e2-linear-rel} using alpha particles emitted from Americium-241.
Using this, we also wish to verify parts of \cite[fig. 5.4]{mel66}.
In addition, using our data, we'd like to determine the range of these particles.

We model our procedure after a similar experiment as outlined in \cite[Ch. 5; \S3.2]{mel66}.
With this setup, instead of manipulating the distance directly, the distance between the sample and the detector was fixed, and the pressure within the experimental vessel was varied to simulate different distances.
To obtain the corresponding effective pressure at STP, we appeal to the following formula
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eff_distance}
	X_\text{eff} = \frac{Dp}{p_\text{atm}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
	X_\text{eff} &= \text{effective distance at STP (cm)} \\
	D &= \text{physical distance between sample and detector (cm)} \\
	p &= \text{pressure of experimentation vessel (mmHg)} \\
	p_\text{atm} &= \text{standard atmospheric pressure (mmHg)\footnotemark,}
\end{align*}
\footnotetext{The value 760 mmHg was used in this experiment}
as it appears in \cite{mel66}.

In addition to collecting energy information, we also seek to investigate the count rate as it varies with respect to distance.
Due to \textit{range straggling} \cite{andrews08}, we expect some slight statistical fluctuations in the range of alpha particles.
In accordance with \cite{andrews08}, the probability distribution of the range of particles can be estimated to be a Gaussian, which is given as
\begin{equation}
	P(r) = \frac{1}{\alpha \sqrt{\pi}}\exp\paren{-\frac{(x-\bar x)^2}{\alpha^2}}.
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
	x &= \text{range of alpha particle (m)} \\
	\bar x &= \text{average range of alpha particle (m)} \\
	\alpha &= \text{straggling parameter}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the following integral
\begin{equation} \label{eq:err_func}
	n_0 \paren{1 - \int_0^x	\frac{1}{\alpha \sqrt{\pi}}\exp\paren{-\frac{(x-\bar x)^2}{\alpha^2}}\,dx},
\end{equation}
denotes the expected relation between counts and distance, where $n_0$ is the total number of counts emitted by the sample (per unit time).

In addition to performing this procedure in air, we repeat this experiment in nitrogen, argon, and helium atmospheres to compare the results of changing the atmosphere.


\section{Procedure}
\label{sec:procedure}
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

The core of the apparatus was a solid-state silicon detector (Ortec TU-014-050-100, $50\,\text{mm}^2$ active area, 14\,keV energy resolution) mounted inside a sealed vacuum chamber, with an Am-241 source on a rack-and-pinion drive that allowed fine adjustment of the source-to-detector distance. When an alpha particle enters the detector, it ionizes the silicon and produces electron-hole pairs at a rate of one pair per 3.62\,eV deposited---so the total collected charge is directly proportional to the particle's kinetic energy. That charge pulse was amplified and shaped before reaching the MCA (see Fig.~\ref{fig:block_diagram}), which sorted pulses into 1024 channels by amplitude; the resulting histogram is the alpha energy spectrum (see Fig.~\ref{fig:histograms}).

    Due to the increased distance traveled by these lower energy particles, the statistical fluctuations caused by range straggling are magnified, thus causing the increased variance at these extremes.}

\end{figure}



Rather than mechanically varying the source-to-detector distance for each data point, we controlled the gas pressure inside the chamber to change the effective path length. A mechanical pump evacuated the chamber down to $\sim$50\,mmHg (below which the detector risks radiation damage), and the chamber could be backfilled with helium, argon, or nitrogen from external cylinders in addition to ambient air.

\subsection{Energy Calibration}
\label{sec:calibration}


To establish the energy-to-channel conversion, we used a pulse generator to inject known charges into the preamplifier input via a test capacitor of $C_1 = 0.4095 \pm 0.001$\,pF. The equivalent energy deposited for a given pulser voltage $V_\text{pulser}$ is
\begin{equation}
    E(\text{MeV}) = 2.26 \times 10^{13} \cdot C_1 \cdot V_{\text{pulser}}
    \label{eq:calibration}
\end{equation}
We collected 15-s spectra at 12 pulser voltages from 0.035\,V to 0.575\,V, corresponding to equivalent energies of 0.32--5.32\,MeV. The centroid channel of each peak was extracted and is tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:calibration-data}.

A linear fit $E = a + b \cdot \text{ch}$ to the twelve calibration points yields
\begin{equation}
    a = -0.006 \pm 0.028\ \text{MeV}, \quad
    b = 5.59 \times 10^{-3} \pm 5.0 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{MeV/channel},
    \label{eq:calib-fit}
\end{equation}
with $R^2 = 0.9997$, confirming excellent linearity over the full 0.3--5.3\,MeV range.
The intercept is consistent with zero within its uncertainty, indicating no measurable
offset in the electronics chain. This fit is used in all subsequent energy calculations.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurement Procedure}
\label{sec:measurement}

To keep the source-to-detector distance fixed across all measurements, we used the ``range-out'' position---the point at which alpha particles can no longer reach the detector at atmospheric pressure. We found this by slowly moving the source away from the detector until counts dropped to zero, which happened at a scale reading of $s = 10.8$\,cm. The source was locked there for all four gases. The physical source-to-detector distance follows from the chamber geometry as $D = (s - 6.58)\,\text{cm} = 4.22 \pm 0.13$\,cm.

With the source fixed, we swept the chamber pressure from $\sim$50\,mmHg up to near atmospheric and collected a 45-s MCA spectrum at each pressure point. We initially tried 15-s runs but the statistics were too poor to reliably locate the peak centroid, so all reported data use 45\,s. At each pressure we pulled the centroid channel from the spectrum and converted it to energy using the calibration from \S\ref{sec:calibration}. The effective path length at STP is then $X_\text{eff} = Dp/P_\text{atm}$, where $p$ is the chamber pressure and $P_\text{atm}$ is atmospheric pressure on the day of the measurement. Pressure readings carry an uncertainty of $\pm 0.1$\,mmHg.

\subsubsection{Air}
\label{sec:air_procedure}

We took 16 spectra in air at pressures from 54.8 to 765.1\,mmHg. At full atmospheric pressure no counts arrived at all, and at 721.2\,mmHg only 54 counts appeared over 45\,s---right at the edge of the range. Below 674.9\,mmHg the count rate settled into a stable plateau of roughly 1000--1200 counts per 45\,s. Because the count rate drops sharply near range-out, we added three extra points at 686.6, 700.8, and 711.9\,mmHg to better resolve that transition region.

\subsubsection{Helium}
\label{sec:he_procedure}

Helium has a much lower electron density than the diatomic gases, so alpha particles lose energy more slowly per centimeter and the range is much longer. We needed to go well above atmospheric pressure to see significant energy loss over our fixed distance, so we took 19 spectra from 50.9\,mmHg up to $\sim$2000\,mmHg. Even at the highest pressures the MCA peak only shifted down to around channel 624, meaning the particles were still arriving with substantial energy---we never observed range-out in helium. The spectrum at 50.9\,mmHg showed MCA clipping and was dropped from the analysis.

\subsubsection{Argon}
\label{sec:ar_procedure}

In argon, we took 16 spectra from 50.4 to 782.0\,mmHg, with the source at the same $s = 10.8$\,cm position used for all other gases. Near the cutoff, at 770.8 and 759.6\,mmHg, the peak landed close to channel 47 where MCA clipping occurs, so those two points were excluded from the fits. At 782.0\,mmHg only a single count appeared over 45\,s, confirming the particles had essentially stopped.

\subsubsection{Nitrogen}
\label{sec:n2_procedure}

We collected 24 spectra in nitrogen from 50.8 to 782.3\,mmHg. Since air is roughly 78\% nitrogen, we expected similar behavior to air, and the range-out did fall at nearly the same pressure. To get good coverage of both the drop-off region and the plateau, we added extra points in the 250--440\,mmHg and 650--730\,mmHg ranges. Two data points---near 420 and 256\,Torr---were clear outliers relative to the neighboring measurements. We took several additional spectra at nearby pressures to confirm they were anomalous rather than a real feature, and excluded them from the fits.

\section{Data Analysis and Results}
\label{sec:results}
%===============================================================================

\subsection{Energy Calibration}
\label{sec:results-calibration}
The data collected during the energy calibration procedure (described in \S\ref{sec:calibration}) yields a linear relationship (shown in
Table \ref{tab:calibration-data} and Fig.~\ref{fig:calibration}), which is what we expect given the specifications of the equipment provided by the manufacturer.
Performing a linear regression, we obtain the formula
\begin{align}
	E &= (5.59\times 10^{-3})C - 0.01 \\
	\sigma_E &= \sqrt{(0.03)^2 + ((5\times 10^{-5})C)^2 + ((5.59\times 10^{-3})\sigma_C)^2}
\end{align}

\subsection{Alpha Particle Range}
\label{sec:alpharange}
\subsubsection{Air}
\label{sec:air-analysis}
The first task was to convert pressure to effective distance with equation \ref{eq:eff_distance}.
The distance used for this measurement was $4.22 \pm 0.13$  cm (and a standard $760$ mmHg was used as $p_\text{atm}$).
Then uncertainty can be obtained through the following formula
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{X_\text{eff}} = \sqrt{\paren{\frac{p\,\sigma_D}{p_\text{atm}}}^2 + \paren{\frac{D\,\sigma_p}{p_\text{atm}}}^2}
\end{equation}

For air, plotting the count rate against the effective distance yields the graph in figure \ref{fig:air-counts}.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.6\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{plots/PyPlots/air_counts_plot.png}}
	\caption{Count rate data plotted against effective range for experiment in air.
		Equation \ref{eq:err_func} was then used to fit the trendline.}
	\label{fig:air-counts}
\end{figure}
Using the data from the fit, we estimate the average range is $3.7 \pm 0.5$ cm with a straggling parameter of $0.3 \pm 0.5$.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.6\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{plots/PyPlots/air_e2.png}}
	\caption{Energy squared plotted against energy for experiment in air.
	A scaled Gaussian (using the parameters from the count rate analysis) is plotted in blue.
	The trendline is obtained from a linear regression of points with $X_\text{eff}\le 3.4$.}
	\label{fig:air-energy}
\end{figure}
Moving on, we plot the square of the energy against effective distance and obtain the plot in figure \ref{fig:air-energy}.
We wish to fit a linear regression with the points before they start to range out.
Using the analysis from the count data, we know the particles begin to range out at 3.7.
However, due to statistical variation, we wish to exclude points with $X_\text{eff} \le R_0-\alpha$ (At this range, 0.92 have yet to range out).
Using this analysis, we obtain the trendline as observed in figure \ref{fig:air-energy}.
The trend of this fit supports equation \ref{eq:e2-linear-rel} as outlined in \S\ref{sec:intro}.

Observe in equation \ref{eq:e2-linear-rel}, the intercept is the square of the initial energy.
If we let $b$ be the intercept, then the uncertainty associated with this computation is
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{E_0} = \frac{\sigma_b}{2\sqrt{b}}
\end{equation}
Using the intercept of the trendline in figure \ref{fig:air-energy}, we obtain that the initial energy of these particles is $5.43 \pm 0.03$ MeV (according to \cite{qadr17}, the accepted value for Am-241 is 5.443 MeV).
In addition, by setting the $E^2 = 0$ (the point where the particles have no energy; hence range out), we can solve for $r$,
\begin{equation}
	r=-\frac{b}{a}
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $b$ are the slope and intercept, respectively.
Here, $r$ presents the range of the particles emitted from Am-241, and using our parameters, we obtain the value $3.54\pm 0.08$ cm, which is within our uncertainty from our count rate analysis.


In addition, if we let $R$ represent the range of a particle, we can deduce its energy $E$ by using the regression model seen in figure \ref{fig:air-energy} as follows:
\begin{align}
	E^2 = a(R_0 - R) + b = -aR
\end{align}
where $R_0$ is the range as computed before (x-intercept).
Solving for $R$ and taking $\log$ on both sides gives
\begin{equation}
	\log R = 2\log(E) - \log(a).
\end{equation}
Comparing with \cite[fig 5.4]{mel66}, we find these relationships match for where this linear regression was taken (which was from the initial energy of Am-241 alpha particles and right before they began to range out).

\subsubsection{Nitrogen}
Using the same method, the plots of count rate and energy squared against effective distance are analyzed.
The results are displayed in figures \ref{fig:n2-counts} and \ref{fig:n2-energy}.\footnote{Observing figure \ref{fig:n2-counts}, at an effective distance of 1.44 cm, a point was taken that was more than 14.6$\sigma$ from the value observed from values taken near it.
	For this reason, this point was discarded when performing the analysis.}

The corresponding alpha range as derived from the count rate is $3.7 \pm 0.5$ cm.
From the energy data, we obtain a range of $3.56 \pm 0.06$ cm and an initial energy of $5.42 \pm 0.02$ MeV.
This value is similar to that of air, which we expect since air is mostly nitrogen.

We find that this data produces a similar linear relationship between particle energy and range by running the same analysis as in \S\ref{sec:air-analysis}.

\subsubsection{Argon}
Using the same method, the plots of count rate and energy squared against effective distance are analyzed.
The results are displayed in figures \ref{fig:ar-counts} and \ref{fig:ar-energy}.

\end{figure}

The corresponding alpha range as derived from the count rate is $4.0 \pm 0.3$ cm.
From the energy data, we obtain a range of $3.83 \pm 0.14$ cm and an initial energy of $5.34 \pm 0.06$ MeV.

Since argon has a very high ionization potential, observing the $\ln$ term in equation \ref{eq:berte}, we find that this high ionization potential lowers the magnitude of this term (since the numerator in this term is orders of magnitude larger than the denominator).
Since we assume $\beta$ is small, we see that this high ionization potential contributes to decreasing the magnitude. of the term
\begin{equation}
	\sbrak{\ln\paren{\frac{2m_e v^2}{I(1-\beta^2)}} - \beta^2}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, particles in argon lose energy more slowly.
This explanation very roughly explains how this deviation from previous results is supported by the theory.

We find that this data produces a similar linear relationship between particle energy and range by running the same analysis as in \S\ref{sec:air-analysis}.

\subsubsection{Helium}
Observing the count rate vs effective distance plot for helium in figure \ref{fig:he-counts},
\begin{figure}[hbt!] 
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.6\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{plots/PyPlots/he_counts_plot.png}}
	\caption{Count rate data plotted against effective range for experiment in helium.}
	\label{fig:he-counts}
\end{figure}
for the points we measure, helium failed to range out.
In figure \ref{fig:he-energy}, this is made even more apparent since the points don't intersect the $x$-axis.
\begin{figure}[hbt!]
	\centering
	\resizebox{0.6\linewidth}{!}{\includegraphics{plots/PyPlots/he_e2.png}}
	\caption{Energy squared plotted against effective range for experiment in argon.
	A scaled Gaussian (using the parameters from the count rate analysis) is plotted in blue.
	The trendline is obtained from a linear regression of every point.}
	\label{fig:he-energy}
\end{figure}
For this reason, we didn't filter the points when we ran the linear regression for energy squared versus effective distance.
Then, using this line, like before, we can compute the range of the particle, which we find is $18.64 \pm 0.02$ cm, and the initial energy of the particles is $5.55 \pm 0.06$ MeV.
Since helium is the lightest of all of the gases (meaning the alpha particles are able to retain more energy between collisions), and since helium is a noble gas (like argon), this result is within expectation.

We find that this data produces a similar linear relationship between particle energy and range by running the same analysis as in \S\ref{sec:air-analysis}.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As observed in \S\ref{sec:results}, the values that were obtained for initial energy were very close to the accepted values for Am-241.

Then, for the ranges which we computed, comparing against the values found in \cite{nistdata},\footnote{We convert their values to compare with ours by dividing by the density of the corresponding gas.
These values were found \url{https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Star/compos.pl?refer=ap&matno=104}}
we obtain table \ref{tab:acc-values}.

\begin{table}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \caption{Measured ranges and NIST projected ranges, values obtained from \cite{nistdata}.}
    \label{tab:acc-values}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
        \toprule
        Gas & Measured Range (cm) & NIST Range $(\text{g/cm}^2)$ & Converted Range (cm) \\
        \midrule
        Air             & $3.55 \pm 0.08$   & $4.93\times 10^{-3}$  & 4.09 \\
        $\text{N}_2$    & $3.56 \pm 0.06$   & $4.85\times 10^{-3}$  & 4.16 \\
        Ar              & $3.83 \pm 0.14$   & $7.25\times 10^{-3}$  & 4.36 \\
        He              & $18.64 \pm 0.02$  & $3.85\times 10^{-3}$  & 23.1 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The measured ranges are systematically lower than the NIST projected values, indicating that the effective stopping power in our setup was higher than what the NIST projects.
The most likely cause is trace impurities in the gas samples---water vapor in particular has a higher stopping power than nitrogen or the noble gases---though a systematic offset in the physical distance $D$ between the source housing and the active silicon layer also cannot be ruled out.
MCA clipping at high pressures in argon affected two data points, which were excluded from the fits; any residual gain nonlinearity at the high end of the energy scale could also bias the extracted range downward.

In the future, taking longer spectra near range-out (where count rates are low and statistics are poor) would improve the count rate fits, and a more careful determination of the source-to-active-layer distance would reduce the dominant systematic uncertainty in $X_\text{eff}$.

However, the results we obtained successfully verified equation \ref{eq:berte-non-rel} and theoretical predictions of the energy of alpha particles produced by Am-241 atoms.
