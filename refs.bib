	abstract = {A simple student experiment investigating dependence on air pressure of the attenuation of alpha particles in air is described. An equation giving the pressure needed to absorb all alpha particles of a given energy is derived from the Bethe--Bloch formula. Results are presented for the attenuation of alpha particles from americium 241 and radium 226. The experimental results are in close agreement with the theoretical predictions.},
